## Lecture 10: IoT - Part 1 (Guest Lecture)

### IoT Four-Layer Architecture
**Critical for Understanding IoT Systems**:

1. **Device Layer (The Things)**:
   - Smart sensors (temperature, light, motion)
   - Smart actuators (displays, sound, motors)
   - Computation capability (can run programs)
   - Communication interfaces (wired/wireless)

2. **Network Layer**:
   - WPAN, WLAN, WMAN (short/medium range)
   - Cellular networks (long range)
   - Internet backbone

3. **Data Analytics Layer**:
   - ML/AI algorithms
   - Historical data analytics
   - Streaming data analytics
   - Cloud storage

4. **Application Layer**:
   - Decision making
   - Dashboards, web services
   - Augmented reality

### IoT Hardware Components

**IoT Boards**:
- **Microcontroller Boards** (e.g., Arduino):
  - System on Chip (SoC) with processing cores, RAM, EPROM
  - Executes custom programs on microcontroller

- **Single Board Computers** (e.g., Raspberry Pi):
  - Complete computer on single circuit board
  - Fan-less, low-power, low-profile architecture

**Sensor Node (Mote) Architecture**:
- **Key Components**:
  - Microcontroller (processing/sampling)
  - Data SRAM (critical limiting resource)
  - Flash storage (program images, data logs)
  - Sensor Interface (ADC for analog, digital sensors)
  - Wireless/Wired Network Interface
  - Low-power standby & wakeup capability

### Power Consumption (EXAM CRITICAL)

**Power Consumption Model**:
- Sleep – Active [Wakeup / Work] cycle
- **Average Power**: P_ave = f_sleep × P_sleep + f_wakeup × P_wakeup + f_work × P_work
- **Lifetime**: EnergyStore / (P_ave - P_generated)

**General Design Guideline**:
- Switch off Radio (TX/RX/IDLE) "as soon as possible"
- Radio power consumption roughly same for TX, RX, or IDLE listening
- **Total energy dominated by idle listening**

**Power Spending Factors**:
1. **Duty Cycle**: How often devices are on
2. **Protocol Efficiency**: What they do when on
3. **TX Power**: How much power they transmit (and amplifier efficiency)
4. **Transmission Duration**: Data rate affects energy per bit
5. **Signal Processing**: DSP or RF dominated

**Example Power Values (802.11 PSM)**:
- TX: 700-1100 mW
- RX: 170-350 mW
- Idle: 66-92 mW
- Sleep: 13-142 μW

### Wireless Technologies for IoT

**Communications Criteria**:
1. **Range**: Signal propagation distance
2. **Frequency Bands**: Licensed vs unlicensed, sub-GHz
3. **Power Consumption**: Stable power vs battery
4. **Topology**: Network layouts for connecting objects
5. **Constrained Devices**: Connectivity limitations
6. **Constrained-Node Networks**: Network challenges

**Network Architectures**:
- **Mobile Radio Networks** (Cellular: 2G-5G)
- **Capillary Multi-hop Networks** (Short/medium range + backhauling)
- **Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN)**

**Technology Comparison (Key Parameters)**:

| Technology | Range | Data Rate | Power | Spectrum | Latency |
|------------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Wi-Fi** | ~100m | 100+ Mbps | High | Unlicensed 2.4/5 GHz | Low |
| **Wi-Fi HaLow** | ~1km | Few kbps | Low | Unlicensed sub-1 GHz | 1.6-10s |
| **Bluetooth LE** | ~100m | 1-10 Mbps | Low | Unlicensed 2.4 GHz | Low |
| **ZigBee** | ~100m | 250 kbps | Low | Unlicensed 2.4 GHz | Low |
| **LoRaWAN** | 2-5km urban, 15km rural | 50-290 bps | Very Low | Unlicensed sub-1 GHz | High |
| **NB-IoT** | 10-15km | 20-200 kbps | Low | Licensed | 1.6-10s |
| **LTE-M** | 7-10km | <1 Mbps | Low | Licensed in-band | 10-15ms |
| **EC-GSM** | <25km | 240 kbps | Low | Licensed GSM | 700ms-2s |

### Wi-Fi Power Saving Modes

**Active Mode**: Radio always on (high power)

**Legacy PS Mode (PS-Poll)**:
- Station sleeps between beacons
- Wakes up to receive beacon
- Sends PS-Poll if data buffered at AP
- Significant power savings with increased latency

**Tradeoff**: Latency vs. Power Saving

### Interference at 2.4 GHz (Important)

**Wi-Fi vs ZigBee**:
- Operate on same band
- Wi-Fi typically 100x more power (100 mW vs 1 mW)
- Some ZigBee channels avoid Wi-Fi spectrum (channels 25, 26)

**BLE vs Wi-Fi**:
- BLE advertising channels (37, 38, 39) avoid 802.11 channels 1, 6, 11
- 9 data channels still available for BLE

### Energy Calculations (Practice This!)

**Energy Definition**: Current (A) × Voltage (V) × Time (s) = Power (W) × Time (s)

**Example Calculation**:
- Battery: 180 mAh, 1.5V → Energy = 180×10⁻³ × 3600 × 1.5 = 972 J
- TX Power: 15 mW, Duration: 3 ms → Energy per TX = 15×10⁻³ × 3×10⁻³ = 45 μJ
- Number of transmissions: 972 / (45×10⁻⁶) = 21.6 million
- Lifetime (1 TX/min): 21.6×10⁶ minutes ≈ 15,000 days ≈ 40 years

### IoT Protocol Stack

**Messaging Protocols** (Application Layer):
- MQTT (publish-subscribe, TCP-based)
- CoAP (request-response, UDP-based, lightweight)
- AMQP (message queuing)
- HTTP (web-based, heavier)

**Transport**: TCP (reliable) / UDP (lightweight)
**Network**: IPv4, IPv6, 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power networks)
**PHY/MAC**: IEEE 802.3, 802.11, 802.15.4, 802.15.1 (BLE), others

**Why New Stack Needed**:
- Traditional HTTP/FTP/SNMP too heavy for constrained devices
- TCP/UDP overhead undesirable for low-power
- Need tight coupling with PHY for energy efficiency
- Routing needed for tiny disconnected devices

## Important Formulas

### Shannon's Formula (Channel Capacity)
```
C = B log₂(1 + SNR)
```
- C = Channel capacity (bps)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)
- SNR = Signal-to-Noise Ratio (linear)

### Nyquist Formula (Maximum Data Rate)
```
C = 2B log₂(M)
```
- C = Channel capacity (bps)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)
- M = Number of signaling levels

### SNR Conversion
```
SNRdB = 10 log₁₀(SNR)
```

### Path Loss (Free Space)
```
LdB = 10 log₁₀(Pt/Pr) = 20 log₁₀(4πfd/c) = 20 log₁₀(f) + 20 log₁₀(d) - 147.56
```
- Pt = Transmitted power
- Pr = Received power
- f = Frequency
- d = Distance
- c = Speed of light

### Path Loss (with exponent)
```
LdB = 10 log₁₀(Pt/Pr) = γ·10 log₁₀(4πfd/c)
```
- γ = Path loss exponent (typically 2-4)
