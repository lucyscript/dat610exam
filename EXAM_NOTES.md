## Important Formulas

### Shannon's Formula (Channel Capacity)
```
C = B log₂(1 + SNR)
```
- C = Channel capacity (bps)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)
- SNR = Signal-to-Noise Ratio (linear)

### Nyquist Formula (Maximum Data Rate)
```
C = 2B log₂(M)
```
- C = Channel capacity (bps)
- B = Bandwidth (Hz)
- M = Number of signaling levels

### SNR Conversion
```
SNRdB = 10 log₁₀(SNR)
```

### Path Loss (Free Space)
```
LdB = 10 log₁₀(Pt/Pr) = 20 log₁₀(4πfd/c) = 20 log₁₀(f) + 20 log₁₀(d) - 147.56
```
- Pt = Transmitted power
- Pr = Received power
- f = Frequency
- d = Distance
- c = Speed of light

### Path Loss (with exponent)
```
LdB = 10 log₁₀(Pt/Pr) = γ·10 log₁₀(4πfd/c)
```
- γ = Path loss exponent (typically 2-4)
